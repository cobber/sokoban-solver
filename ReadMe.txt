Description:
============

This is a simple attempt at automatically solving sokoban puzzles.

Sadly, it's a brute force solution and not really very intelligent (yet).

There's no restrictions on the re-use of this code.

Fork-it, play with it, sell it... just don't hassle me about :-)

GIT Notes:
==========

To clone this repository, you're going to have to specify the "stable" branch - sorry about that guys.
But it's simple enough:

% git clone git://github.com/cobber/sokoban-solver.git
% cd sokoban-solver
% git pull origin stable

after that it should work.
